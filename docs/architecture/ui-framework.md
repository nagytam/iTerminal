### `iConsole` — reusable terminal UI framework
General-purpose TUI infrastructure with no knowledge of file managers. Key subsystems:

- **Controls** (`iConsole/Controls/`): `Window` is the base for all interactive UI panels. Controls handle `HandleKeyEventAsync` and render into a buffer.
- **Commands** (`iConsole/Commands/Command.cs`): User actions. Override `Key`, optionally `CanExecute()`, and `ExecuteAsync(object? args)`. Commands are attached to controls and dispatched by the key router. `Command.RunAsync` wraps execution with `CanExecute` gating, exception capture, and `ICommandLogger` recording — dispatch through it, not `ExecuteAsync` directly.
- **Jobs** (`iConsole/Jobs/Job.cs`): Long-running background loops (rendering, keyboard polling, network info). Each `Job` subclass implements `RunIterationAsync`. Jobs are registered as `IJob` singletons and run on the `Desktop` lifecycle, not the `TaskManager`.
- **TaskManager** (`iConsole/Tasks/TaskManager.cs`): Priority queue (`Rendering=0 > Input=1 > Background=2`) with multiple worker threads. Used for one-shot async work (directory enumeration, file copy). `BackgroundTask` is the base; override `ExecuteAsync()` and `Priority`.
- **Data types** (`iConsole/Data/`): `Url`, `Container` (URL scheme constants), `KeyEvent`, `Position`, `Size`, `ConcurrentObservableCollection<T>` (thread-safe, `ReplaceAll` for atomic batch swaps), `ConxelString` (styled character strings for rendering).
- **Services** (`iConsole/Services/`): `IDateTimeProviderService` (cached `DateTime.Now`), `IFrequentExecutionGuardService` (throttles `PropertyChanged` to max ~20/s), `IStopwatchFactory`/`IStopwatch` (injectable timing), `IThemeService`, `IErrorPromptService`.
- **Notifications** (`iConsole/Services/INotificationService.cs`, `Jobs/NotificationJob.cs`, `Controls/Toast.cs`, `Controls/ToastHost.cs`): self-dismissing toasts posted from any thread — see "Notifications and toasts" below.
- **Diagnostics** (`iConsole/Diagnostics/`): `ICommandLogger`/`IScreenLogger` capture command executions and rendered screen snapshots for agentic/behavioural tests. `AddiConsoleCore` registers the `Null*` no-op implementations by default; `iConsole.Test.Core` provides `InMemoryCommandLogger`/`InMemoryScreenLogger`, and `AppHarness` wires those in so tests can assert on what ran and what was drawn.
